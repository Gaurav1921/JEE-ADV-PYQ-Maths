             <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
          So I am Gaurav Singh. I live in Vadodara, Gujarat. Currently I am an undergrad student at NIT-Trichy. Just now we have finished
          our 1st semster of college. So i thought lets do something in ti]his vacation. So here i am with my very own
          website.
               I wont say that I am a computer geek or anything like that but yeah 
          computer is something which excites me, motivates me to learn more & explore this Subject more deeply.
               So thats why i started with HTML, CSS to get started with programming language.  
          I also learned Data Analytics using MS Excel along with Responisve Web Design.
               And yeah maybe you all would have guessed by now that this website was made by me. I have made this as a small project
          so that i can apply all the knowledge i have gained through in these first 3 months of my college
          
          And if i had to define my experienvce during the first 3 montshs @NIT-TRICHY then its simply one of the most 
          fascnating, scintillating expeience i have ever felt. Learnt a lot during this period.
          So therefore i hope you would do the same when you come to NIT-TRICHY or even more better if its at IIT.
