             <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
          So I am Gaurav Singh. I live in Vadodara, Gujarat. Currently I am an undergrad student at NIT-Trichy. Just now we have finished
          our 1st semster of college. So i thought lets do something in this semester break. So here i am with my very own
          website.<br/>
               I wont say that I am a computer geek or anything like that but yeah 
          computer is something which excites me, motivates me to learn more & explore this Subject more deeply.
               So thats why i started with HTML, CSS to get started with programming language.  
          I also learnt Data Analytics using MS Excel along with Responisve Web Design.<br/>
          I have made this website as a small project of mine. And while doing that i also wanted to help the JEE community. As when i was preparing for JEE Adv, sometimes i had 
            to go through like 3-4 websites to check if the answer for it was given correct or not, and also some solutions were not given properly at on site/app.
            So i saw this as an oppurtunity to make a website where i will be uploading all the JEE Adv solutions of Math subject.
          And also it will help me apply all the knowledge i have gained through in these first 3 months of my college.<br/>
          
          And now if i had to define my experience during the first 3 montshs @NIT-TRICHY then its simply one of the most 
          fascinating, scintillating experience i have ever felt. Learnt a lot during this period.
          So therefore i hope you would do the same when you come to NIT-TRICHY or even more better if its at IIT.<br/>
          Want to know my favorite part about this page?<br/>

          Want to stay in touch?<br/>
